# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Summarized-Texts

This script offers a comprehensive workflow for analyzing text sentiment after extractive and abstractive summarization. It supports multiple languages (e.g., English, German, French) and includes the following key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing – Preparing raw text for analysis.
2. Summarization – Applying both extractive and abstractive methods to condense text.
3. Sentiment Analysis – Evaluating the emotional tone of summarized content.
4. Result Evaluation – Assessing performance using metrics such as:
   - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
   - ROUGE and BLEU for summarization quality

The code is adaptable for further customization, such as integrating additional languages or experimenting with alternative models.
